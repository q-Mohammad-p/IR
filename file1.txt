Abstract 
In recent years cloud computing has gained a 
momentum and is transforming the internet 
computing infrastructure. Also the mobile 
applications and mobile devices are developing 
rapidly. Cloud computing is anticipated to bring an 
innovation in mobile computing, where the mobile 
devices can use clouds for data processing, storage 
and other intensive operations. Already there are 
some mobile cloud applications for example 
Google’s Map, Gmail for iPhone and Cisco’s 
WebEx on iPad, however these applications are 
using the Software as a Service model. In this 
paper we introduce state-of-the-art Mobile Cloud 
Computing and its implementation methods. We 
also investigate some critical issues to be solved 
and point-out further future research directions. 
Keywords: cloud computing; mobile cloud 
computing; mobile devices; mobile applications; 
security issues. 
1 Introduction 
The IT industry is always full of a never ending 
buzz, as from the very beginning since 1946 when 
the first computer was invented and till now the 
technology has revolutionized many times. 
Researchers foreseen at that time, mainframe 
computer to be the future of computing, when 
large scale machines and mainframe computers 
were used to perform different tasks and 
applications. Nowadays we do the same tasks but 
in a much cheaper and portable fashion – using 
desktop computer and servers tied together to 
create a so called Cloud Computing System. Cloud 
computing [1-3] is now the hottest research area in 
IT industry. Cloud computing provides resources 
and computing infrastructure on demand basis to 
consumers. The consumers can use applications 
and services on the clouds through internet. 
Nowadays cloud computing is not only limited to 
the personal computer, it also an influence and 
intense impact on the mobile technology. 
Electronic devices like, smart phones, tablets, 
netbook and cloud computing resources are 
converging in a new rapid emerging field of 
Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). The demand for 
the mobile applications is also increasing which 
require more resources to be provided to make user 
experience more better. In the cloud platform 
resources for example Google AppEngine, 
Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure can see mobile 
cloud computing as new paradigm for mobile 
applications. 
Mobile cloud computing is defined as extension of 
cloud computing with a new ad-hoc infrastructure 
based on a mobile device [4]. In scenario of mobile 
cloud computing there are two viewpoints. One is 
a simple viewpoint and other is mobile device 
viewpoint. Simple viewpoint refers that both data 
storage and data processing is carried outside the 
mobile devices. Cloud resources are utilized for 
processing and storage purpose. The advantage of 
this concept is that mobile cloud computing 
applications are not constrained to a certain kind of 
mobile devices or operation systems. Also no need 
to worry for the storage capacity and computation 
speed limitations. While the mobile device view 
point refers that both data storage and data 
processing is done in the mobile device. The 
reason is that nowadays mobile devices (smart 
phones, tablets etc) are more intelligent and highly 
developed. The advantage of such viewpoint is to 
provide user an ownership (to store and maintain 
data on personal mobile device). 
This section started with some introductory 
remarks to cloud computing and mobile cloud 
computing. The rest of the paper is organized as 
follows. Section 2 describe the concept of mobile 
cloud computing and provide a brief explanation 
that why it is needed. In section 3, two mobile 
cloud computing solutions i.e. general purpose
